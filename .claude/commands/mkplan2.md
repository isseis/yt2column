Your goal is to design PR boundaries for an existing `03_implementation_plan.md` and embed them directly into the document.

Work in the following order.

1. Identify the target task directory by following the rules in `docs/dev/developer_guide/task_identification.md`.

2. Read `03_implementation_plan.md` in the target task directory.
   - If the document status is not `approved`, stop and report. PR boundary design requires an approved plan.
   - If `### PR-` sections already exist, stop and report that PR boundaries are already defined. Do not overwrite them unless the user explicitly asks.

3. Read `02_architecture.md` and `01_requirements.md` in the target task directory to understand the component structure and acceptance criteria.

4. Analyse the implementation steps and design PR groupings.

   Apply the following principles:
   - **Reviewability**: Each PR should have a single, coherent concern that a reviewer can evaluate independently (e.g. "all internal API changes", "cmd-layer wiring", "one high-risk subcommand").
   - **Buildability**: Every PR must pass the green gate (defined in `_context.md`) independently. Never split a tightly coupled unit (interface + implementation + test) across PRs.
   - **Risk isolation**: Place high-risk or complex steps (e.g. recovery flows, concurrency) in their own PRs so they can be reviewed in detail without unrelated noise.
   - **Internal-before-cmd**: Changes to `internal/` packages should land before the `cmd/` layer that depends on them.
   - **Small over large**: Prefer more, smaller PRs over fewer large ones; 3–6 PRs is a reasonable target for a medium-sized feature.
   - **Model requirement**: Decide which capability tier the implementing model needs for each PR, so a frontier model is spent where it pays off and the rest is left to a cheaper model backed by the `weakreview.md` pass. Label each PR:
     - `frontier-required` — the PR contains a step that requires an unprecedented design decision (e.g. a Phase 0-style PoC or feasibility probe), or a step matching `mkplan.md` step 8's panel-mode triggers (a heavy integration-test / CI / external-resource surface, or a security-gate / migration step such as a staged rollout or simultaneous behavior raises and lowers).
     - `frontier-recommended` — the PR contains a step whose approach is not yet settled (the plan's `既存コード調査結果` section lists two or more competing implementation approaches for it), a step matching two or more of `mkplan.md`'s Conditional checks, or an isolated high-risk/complex step (e.g. recovery flows, concurrency, state machines).
     - `standard` — everything else.

     Derive these labels in the same analysis pass as **Risk isolation** — they read the same signals (step risk, complexity, external surface). Do not re-analyse the steps a second time for labelling.

   Decide whether any steps need to be reordered within their phase to align with the PR groupings. Only reorder steps when necessary — do not change step order unless it is required to make a PR group coherent.

5. If reordering is needed, update the step sections:
   - Physically move the step sections into the new order.
   - Renumber steps consistently (e.g. `ステップ 1-1`, `ステップ 1-2`, …) using sequential numbers within each phase.
   - Update all cross-references to renumbered steps throughout the document (§3, §4, §5, §6, and any other section that names step numbers).

6. Insert `### PR-N 作成ポイント` sections after each PR group's last step, using the following format exactly:

   ```
   ### PR-N 作成ポイント: <scope label in English>

   **対象ステップ**: X-Y / X-Z / …

   **推奨タイトル**: `feat(<task-id>): <concise English title>`

   **レビュー観点**: <key1> / <key2> / <key3>

   **実装モデル要件**: frontier-required | frontier-recommended | standard

   **判定理由**: <one line>

   - [ ] グリーンゲート（`_context.md` の "Green gate" 参照）がパスしていることを確認した
   - [ ] PR を作成した
   - [ ] PR がマージされた
   - [ ] 次のブランチへ切り替えた（次ステップは新しいブランチで作業する）
   ```

   Where:
   - `N` is a sequential integer starting from 1.
   - `<scope label>` is a short English description of the PR's concern (e.g. `internal API extensions`, `cmd boot layer`, `gc and reprocess subcommands`).
   - `**対象ステップ**` lists the step IDs covered by this PR, separated by ` / `.
   - `**推奨タイトル**` is a conventional commit title in English.
   - `**レビュー観点**` lists 2–4 key review points in Japanese.
   - `**実装モデル要件**` is exactly one of `frontier-required`, `frontier-recommended`, or `standard`, chosen by applying the **Model requirement** principle in step 4 to the steps this PR covers. A PR takes the highest tier any of its steps requires.
   - `**判定理由**` is a one-line Japanese justification naming the specific trigger that decided the tier (e.g. the step ID and its unprecedented design decision, the panel-mode trigger it matches, the competing approaches in `既存コード調査結果`, or the Conditional checks it matches). For `standard`, state that no trigger matched.

7. Add or update a `### 3.2 PR 構成` subsection under §3 (or whichever section covers the implementation overview/test strategy) with a summary table:

   ```markdown
   ### 3.2 PR 構成

   | PR | 対象ステップ | 主な変更内容 | 実装モデル要件 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | PR-1 | 1-1 / 1-2 / 1-3 | … | frontier-required |
   | PR-2 | 1-4 / 1-5 / 1-6 | … | standard |
   …
   ```

8. Update §6 (checklist or completion criteria section) to be organised by PR rather than by phase. Replace any phase-based checklist entries with PR-based ones:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] PR-1 マージ済み（対象ステップ: X-Y / X-Z）
   - [ ] PR-2 マージ済み（対象ステップ: X-Y / X-Z）
   …
   ```

9. Run the critical-review subagent procedure in `.claude/commands/_lib/review-subagent-pattern.md` with these inputs:
    - **ARTIFACT**: the PR boundary design.
    - **PERSONA**: an experienced senior engineer and senior SRE. Direct it to surface PRs that are too large to review, PRs that cannot be built independently, missing risk isolation, and cross-references that were not updated after renumbering. Also direct it to assess whether each PR's `実装モデル要件` label is justified by the steps that PR covers — both an over-labelled PR (frontier tier with no matching trigger) and an under-labelled one (a high-risk or unsettled step labelled `standard`).
    - **FILES**: the implementation plan document, the architecture document, and the requirements document (paths in `_context.md`), as resolved absolute-path strings.
    - **CRITERIA**: every item from the PR boundary review checklist below, copied verbatim.

10. Commit the implementation plan document with a message that explains the PR grouping rationale, only after all review passes are complete and all Critical and Major issues are resolved.

**PR boundary review checklist (use verbatim as evaluation criteria in the subagent prompt above):**
- [ ] Every `### PR-N 作成ポイント` section appears after all steps it covers.
- [ ] Every step belongs to exactly one PR.
- [ ] No step that modifies an `internal/` interface lands in a later PR than the `cmd/` step that depends on it.
- [ ] Each PR group can pass the green gate (defined in `_context.md`) on its own without stubs from future steps.
- [ ] High-risk or complex steps (recovery, concurrency, state machines) are isolated in their own PR or placed last in a PR so they do not block review of simpler changes.
- [ ] Every PR marker's `実装モデル要件` label is consistent with its risk-isolation status — a PR containing an isolated high-risk step is not labeled `standard`.
- [ ] Every PR marker has a `判定理由` line that names the specific trigger behind its `実装モデル要件` label (or states that none matched, for `standard`).
- [ ] The `**対象ステップ**` field in each PR marker lists exactly the steps in that group and no others.
- [ ] The `### 3.2 PR 構成` table is present and consistent with the PR marker sections.
- [ ] §6 checklist entries reference PRs (not phases) and are consistent with the PR markers.
- [ ] All step-number cross-references in the document (§3, §4, §5, §6, step descriptions) reflect the final numbering after any reordering.
- [ ] `推奨タイトル` values are valid conventional commit titles in English.
- [ ] `レビュー観点` items are specific and meaningful — not generic placeholders.

When finished, provide a concise summary of the PR grouping decisions and any assumptions made.

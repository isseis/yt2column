Fix unresolved PR review threads for PR `$ARGUMENTS` (or, if no argument was
given, the PR for the current branch).

There is no `Workflow` tool in this environment, so run the six phases below
**yourself**, sequentially, using the `Agent` tool (`run_in_background: false`)
for each phase — do not try to do the work directly in this conversation, and
do not skip a phase. Each phase's agent has no memory of previous phases, so
its prompt must be self-contained: pass it the exact data it needs (thread
lists, triage results, etc.) inlined as JSON. Instruct every agent to reply
with **only** a single JSON object matching the shape given — no prose, no
markdown code fences — since there is no schema validation to fall back on;
if an agent's reply doesn't parse as JSON, re-invoke it once with that
constraint repeated more forcefully before giving up.

Model tiering (mirrors the original workflow's cost design): use
`model: "haiku"` for the purely mechanical phases (Fetch, Build, Reply, Wrap);
leave `model` unset (defaults to this session's model) for the phases that
require code reasoning (Triage, Fix).

Build checks for this project (see `_context.md` "Tech-stack convention" —
keep this in sync if that table changes): `make fmt && make test && make lint`

## Convergence policy

This loop has no natural end: a push triggers a fresh review, and a review
returns findings whenever it is asked. Stop by policy, not by exhausting
findings.

- **Round cap**: apply at most two fixpr rounds to the same PR. From the third
  round, act on `must-fix` only and leave the rest.
- **Severity floor**: once every remaining finding is `no-harm` (cosmetic or
  invalid), the review has converged — stop editing and merge.
- **Batch**: push once per round; a push per finding triggers a review per
  finding.
- **Accept, don't chase**: a finding that is a mirror case of a rule already
  fixed is closed by generalizing that rule (Phase 3), not by another
  per-instance patch. If it recurs after that, record it as accepted risk or a
  new issue and merge; do not reopen the same rule again.
- The Final report states whether the round was substantive or recurring churn
  and whether the floor is reached.

## Shared rules: document levels and the handoff contract

Phases 2 and 3 and the Final report inline this section verbatim into their
agent prompts. Edit these rules here only; do not restate them in the phase
bodies.

**R1 — Document levels (the off-level test).** Each process document states
only what is at its own level:

- `01_requirements.md`: observable behavior — what is accepted, which sentinel
  a rejection maps to, what state changes. Valid exception: user-facing CLI and
  configuration options are part of the accepted contract, so a correction to
  them is `"valid"`, not `"off-level"`.
- `02_architecture.md`: components, responsibilities, interfaces (including
  their method signatures and field types), data flow, design decisions. Valid
  exception: public interface definitions are architecture content.
- `03_implementation_plan.md`: phases, concrete tasks, files to modify, and the
  verification approach at planning altitude.

A comment is `"off-level"` when it asks a document to carry detail below its
level — for `01_requirements.md`: which library API, a flag passed to an
implementation dependency (e.g. a `yt-dlp` option), or pre-check to use, how
malformed input is detected, internal data structures or file layout,
temporary-file or retry mechanics, standard-library pitfalls, how a test is
constructed; for `02_architecture.md`: internal or helper function signatures,
specific call sequences, line-level code, test code structure; for
`03_implementation_plan.md`: exact assertions, full shell pipelines,
line-level code, test code structure — even when the comment is technically
correct. Use `"off-level"` also when the commented passage already
over-specifies such detail.

**R2 — Handoff routing.** Route by the phase the concern belongs to, not by
the commented document:

| Concern level | Destination | Consumer |
|---|---|---|
| design (raised on `01_requirements.md`) | `design_handoff.md` | `/mkarch` |
| architecture (raised on `01_requirements.md`) | `design_handoff.md` | `/mkarch` |
| implementation (raised on `01_requirements.md` or `02_architecture.md`) | `implementation_handoff.md` | `/mkplan` |
| plan-level (raised on `03_implementation_plan.md`) | none — retain the obligation in the plan at planning altitude | — |

**R3 — Handoff lifecycle.** Any change to a handoff item — add, extend,
correct, replace, or delete — is a decision change. Set the consumer that
already consumed it back to `draft`, and any later approved document after it,
even when no process-document text was edited:

- a `design_handoff.md` item reopens `02_architecture.md`, and then
  `03_implementation_plan.md`;
- an `implementation_handoff.md` item reopens `03_implementation_plan.md`.

Say so in the reply.

**R4 — Off-level reply.** The reply names where the concern was recorded: the
handoff item (`design_handoff.md` H-NN or `implementation_handoff.md` I-NN) or,
for a plan-level concern, the plan section or task where the obligation was
retained, plus the abstraction-level change made to the commented passage.

**R5 — Handoff item format.** Write in the project's document language. If the
file does not exist, create it with a short header stating its role: it
collects concerns raised in review that belong to a later phase, and that
phase's document (architecture document or implementation plan) records, for
each item, the approach taken or why it does not apply. Add the concern as the
next numbered item (`H-NN` in `design_handoff.md`, `I-NN` in
`implementation_handoff.md`) with: what the concern is, why it matters, a
candidate approach, and the related F-/AC- IDs. If an existing item already
covers it, extend that item instead of adding a duplicate. If the commented
document does not yet link to the handoff document, add one sentence that does.

## Phase 1 — Fetch (model: haiku)

Agent prompt:

> Run `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json number,url,headRefName` (omit `$ARGUMENTS`
> to use the current branch's PR if none was given).
> If no PR exists, return `{"found": false}`.
>
> Otherwise:
> 1. Extract owner and repo from the `url` field (format
>    `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO/pull/N`).
> 2. Fetch unresolved review threads:
>
> ```
> gh api graphql -F owner=OWNER -F repo=REPO -F number=NUMBER -f query='
>   query($owner:String!, $repo:String!, $number:Int!) {
>     repository(owner:$owner, name:$repo) {
>       pullRequest(number:$number) {
>         reviewThreads(first:100) {
>           pageInfo { hasNextPage }
>           nodes {
>             id
>             isResolved
>             comments(first:10) {
>               nodes { id databaseId body path line url author { login } }
>             }
>           }
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   }
> '
> ```
>
> 3. Filter to nodes where `isResolved=false`.
> 4. For each thread, use the FIRST comment's `databaseId`, `path`, `line`, `url`.
>    Concatenate the fetched comments (capped at `first:10` per thread) into a
>    `body` field, prefixing each with `@author: `. On busy threads there may be
>    more than 10 comments; `body` will only contain the first 10 fetched.
>    The `threadId` is the thread node's `id` (not the comment id).
> 5. Set `capHit=true` if `pageInfo.hasNextPage` is true (more threads exist
>    beyond the 100-node cap); otherwise `false`.
> 6. Reply with only this JSON: `{"found": true, "owner": "...", "repo": "...",
>    "number": N, "capHit": bool, "threads": [{"threadId": "...", "databaseId":
>    N, "body": "...", "path": "...", "line": N, "url": "..."}]}`

If `found=false`: report "No PR found" and stop — do not run further phases.
If `threads` is empty: report "No unresolved review threads — nothing to do"
and stop.
If `capHit=true`: note in your final report that the 100-thread fetch cap was
hit, so threads beyond it are invisible to this run; a re-run after resolving
this batch will pick up the remainder.

## Phase 2 — Triage (model: default)

Agent prompt (inline the fetched `threads` JSON from Phase 1):

> Triage these unresolved PR review threads for `OWNER/REPO#NUMBER`.
>
> Project conventions: read `CLAUDE.md` for the design principles, Go idioms, and
> testing rules this codebase holds itself to, and judge each comment against
> those. Beyond it: source comments are English only, one line where possible, and
> explain WHY rather than WHAT. Build checks are `make fmt && make test && make lint`.
>
> For EACH thread: read the source file at `path:line` for context, then
> classify two independent dimensions.
>
> `verdict` — is the suggestion right for this codebase?
> - `"valid"` — fix clearly improves correctness, clarity, or convention alignment
> - `"off-level"` — the thread is on a process document and asks it to carry
>   detail that belongs to a later phase (see "Abstraction-level check" below)
> - `"invalid"` — suggestion is wrong or inapplicable in this context
> - `"unclear"` — genuinely uncertain
>

Split the returned `threads` into `valid`, `off-level`, `invalid`, `unclear`
by `verdict`. Report the counts and cluster count before continuing.

## Phase 3 — Fix (model: default)

Skip this phase entirely if both `valid` and `off-level` are empty (go
straight to Phase 4 with no fixes applied).

Agent prompt (inline `clusters` from Phase 2, the `valid` threads, and the
`off-level` threads with their `behaviorGap`, `path`, `line`, and comment
`body` from Phase 1):

> Apply ALL of the following fixes to the repository files.

> Off-level handling, handoff routing, handoff lifecycle, and the reply

>       the verification approach at planning altitude for the implementation
>       plan document (`03_implementation_plan.md`). Never renumber an

>       observable obligation, and delete one that states only later-phase
>       mechanics, leaving its ID unused (as the requirements process guide
>       allows).
>    c. If `behaviorGap` is true, state the missing behavior at the document's
>       level (for the requirements document, an observable condition in the
>       relevant F-/AC- item, not a mechanism).
>    d. Record the concern in the handoff document named by R2, using the item
>       format and dedup rule in R5. A concern raised on the implementation

>       its obligation at planning altitude in the plan itself — state what
>       must be verified, not the exact assertion or shell pipeline — and do
>       NOT park it in `implementation_handoff.md`.
> 4. Apply R3 to the Document Status of every process document you edited and
>    every handoff item you added or changed, per "Editing an approved
>    document" in the requirements process guide
>    (`docs/dev/developer_guide/requirements_process.md`): a decision change

## Phase 4 — Build + push (model: haiku)

Skip this phase (treat as `{success: true, commitSha: "", pushed: false}`) if
both `valid` and `off-level` were empty in Phase 2.

Agent prompt:

> Run the build checks, then commit and push if they pass. Push here, before
> the reply phase, so a reviewer asked to re-check sees the fix on the remote
> branch (not the pre-fix revision).
>
> 1. `make fmt && make test && make lint`
> 2. If all pass:
>    ```
>    git add -A
>    git diff --cached --quiet && COMMITTED=0 || COMMITTED=1
>    if [ "$COMMITTED" = "1" ]; then git commit -m "fix: address PR #NUMBER review comments" || { COMMITTED=0; false; }; fi
>    ```
> 3. Only if a commit was actually created (`COMMITTED=1`), get the commit SHA
>    via `git log -1 --format=%H`, then push it with `git push`. If the push
>    fails, treat the phase as failed (`success=false`) so the reply phase does
>    not run against an unpushed fix. If no commit was created (`COMMITTED=0`),
>    use the empty string and do not push, but first run `git fetch --prune`,
>    then `git rev-list --count '@{upstream}..HEAD'` to check for commits in HEAD
>    missing from the remote branch. If the count is nonzero, return
>    `success=false` with an error identifying the unpushed commits. If either
>    command fails (including a missing upstream), return `success=false` with
>    that command's error output. Continue to Phase 5 and Phase 6 only when
>    the count is zero.
> 4. Reply with only this JSON: `{"success": true, "commitSha": "...",
>    "pushed": bool, "error": ""}`. If any build check, commit, remote check,
>    or push fails,
>    `{"success": false, "commitSha": "", "pushed": false, "error": "..."}`
>    with the failed step (including the command) and its error output in
>    `error`; distinguish build-check failures from push failures. Do NOT
>    commit or push on a build failure.

If `success=false`: report the actual failed step and its error output
(distinguishing build-check failures from push failures), and stop — do not
run Phase 5 or 6.

## Phase 5 — Reply + resolve (model: haiku)

Build the candidate list yourself (not via an agent) before invoking this phase:

- Take every thread where `verdict="invalid"`, plus every thread where
  `verdict` is `"valid"` or `"off-level"` AND `applied=true` in the Phase 3
  fixes.
- For each, resolve `replyBody`: use the Phase 3 fix's `replyBody` if present
  (for applied valid and off-level threads), else the Phase 2 triage
  `replyBody`.
- Look up each thread's `databaseId` and `url` from the Phase 1 fetch data.
- Threads with no `databaseId` cannot be replied to automatically — set them
  aside for the "skipped" list in your final report; do not send them to the
  agent.
- Threads with an empty `replyBody` — also set aside for "skipped"; do not
  send them to the agent.
- Only threads with both a `databaseId` and a non-empty `replyBody` are
  "actionable". If there are none, skip this phase entirely.

For actionable threads, build one shell block per thread:

```
# Thread <threadId> (comment <databaseId>)
gh api repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number>/comments/<databaseId>/replies -F body=@- <<'REPLYBODY_EOF' && gh api graphql -F threadId=<threadId> -f query='mutation($threadId:ID!){resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$threadId}){thread{id isResolved}}}'
<replyBody>
REPLYBODY_EOF
```

Agent prompt:

> Post replies and resolve threads for PR #NUMBER by running the following
> commands sequentially (not in parallel — avoids RPM/TPM rate limits). Each
> block posts a reply (`-F body=@-`, piped from a quoted heredoc,
> `<<'REPLYBODY_EOF'`) then, only if that succeeds (`&&`), resolves the
> thread. The heredoc must stay on the same logical command line as the
> `&&`-chained resolve command, with the body text and closing
> `REPLYBODY_EOF` delimiter following immediately after — do not restructure
> this into separate commands or reorder the lines. This piping avoids
> interpolating `replyBody` — LLM-generated text that may contain double
> quotes, backticks, or `$(...)` — into a shell string. Do not switch to
> `-f body="..."` inline quoting, `-f body=@-` (lowercase `-f` does NOT
> support the `@-` stdin-read syntax — only the uppercase `-F` typed-field
> flag does; using `-f` silently posts the literal string `@-` as the
> comment body), or hand-build a JSON literal.
>
> IMPORTANT: the reply endpoint requires the `/pulls/<number>/` segment
> (`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{pull_number}/comments/{comment_id}/replies`).
> A path without it (`.../pulls/comments/...`) is a different resource and
> 404s for replies — do not drop it.
>
> `<inline the shell blocks built above>`

## Phase 6 — Wrap: PR description (model: haiku)

Agent prompt:

> Verify the PR description is still accurate. The fix commit was already
> pushed in Phase 4, so do not push again.
>
> 1. `gh pr view NUMBER --json title,body`
> 2. `git log --oneline -10`
> 3. Only if the description is significantly stale (approach changed, scope
>    shifted) AND you have drafted a concrete final title and body from the
>    actual PR content, run:
>    ```
>    gh pr edit NUMBER --title "<real title>" --body-file - <<'EOF'
>    <real body>
>    EOF
>    ```
>    Never pass placeholder text — if you have not drafted concrete
>    replacement text, skip the edit entirely so the real PR description is
>    preserved.

---

## Final report

After all phases complete (or a phase aborted early), report the result to
the user with **both** of the following — bare counts alone are not enough:

1. **Summary line**: PR, fixed / off-level (deferred to a handoff document) /
   invalid / unclear counts, clusters, and commit SHA (or "no commit" / "build failed" / "no PR found" / "nothing to
   do" if a phase stopped early).

2. **Bot-comment assessment**: a table built from the Phase 2 triage results
   (`topic`, `severity`, `verdict`) plus the Phase 3 `applied` flag, grouped by
   `severity`, so the user sees what each comment raised and how much it
   mattered — not just that N were "fixed". Use these levels:
   - 🔴 **must-fix** — real bug / correctness or security defect
   - 🟡 **worth-fixing** — legitimate improvement, not a bug
   - 🟢 **no-harm** — cosmetic, or invalid/inapplicable: safe to ignore

   For each thread show its `topic`, its `verdict`, whether a fix was
   `applied`, for off-level threads where the concern was recorded (the
   handoff item, or the plan section or task for a plan-level concern), and
   (for unresolved/unclear ones) the `url`. Then give a one-line overall read:
   was this round substantive or recurring churn, is the severity floor
   reached (Convergence policy), and is it safe to merge rather than run
   again. If most threads were off-level, say so: the document is converging
   and the remaining concerns now wait in the handoff document. Name every
   process document Phase 3 returned from `approved` to `draft` (edited
   documents and the later-phase documents reset with them), so the user knows
   it needs re-approval before the next phase proceeds.

3. **Skipped threads**: list every thread left out of Phase 5 (unclear
   verdict, valid- or off-level-but-unapplied, missing `databaseId`, or empty
   `replyBody`) with its URL so the user can resolve it manually.
